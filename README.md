This is a public repo designed for the Catsky AI community. This code was created using AI by a cat with no prior  coding
experience. As we are all learning, I am hopeful that we can use this public repo to build out our Cardano trading bot. 

The bot, in it's current form, is used simply to interact with the minswap v2 smart contract to execute trades.
This basic code is designed to swap 1 ADA for it's respctive amount of Catsky, based on it's currrent price. 

I am hopeful that we can use template to make automated trades in the future, to eventually create more complex trading bots to create 
revenue for the project. 

Please DM us on .Catsky on discord or @catskycrypto on X.
